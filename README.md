# 🛍️ User-Based Product Management System

A full-stack web application built using **Django**, designed to manage products with user-based access control. This system allows users to register, log in securely, and manage their own list of products with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

Ideal for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand real-world Django applications, database handling, and user authentication.

## 🎯 Project Description

The **User-Based Product Management System** is designed to simulate a basic inventory or e-commerce backend for individual users. Once registered, each user can:

- Manage their own products independently (no data sharing across users).
- Perform operations like adding new products, editing details, deleting items, and viewing their product list.
- Securely log in and log out of the system using Django's authentication framework.

This project helps you understand the foundation of user sessions, CRUD logic, and the integration of frontend (HTML/CSS) with backend logic and SQL databases in Django.
